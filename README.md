# 🚗 Car Price Prediction Web App

A Machine Learning–based web application that predicts the **selling price of a used car** based on key features such as year, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and number of previous owners.

The application is built using **Python**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**, and provides an easy-to-use, interactive interface for real-time predictions.
